   <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>
      With a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a passion for storytelling and
      technology, I strive to make visual effects to a standard that leaves a 
      positive impact on the audience. 
      <p>Currently a VFX student at the National Film and Television School, I specialize
      in compositing, including rotoscoping, plate preparation, marker removal and cleanup, tracking and 3D compositing. Have also experienced all aspects of the VFX pipeline, from previz and modelling, to on-set and post-production, such as HDRIs, photogrammetry, set survey, and matchmove.
      </p>
      <p>Experienced in using <em>Nuke</em>, as well as the fundamentals of <em>Maya</em>, <em>Unreal Engine</em>, <em>Photoshop</em> and <em>PTGui</em>. Also have knowledge of Python, HTML and CSS, the former of which has been utilized to produce basic Nuke scripts to optimize workflow.</p>
