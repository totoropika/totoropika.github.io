### Finally launched this website after learning how to implement HTML, CSS and Jekyll (a static site generator) over the past few weeks. It still needs a few more tweaks and improvements, but I'm hoping to get better over time. The website still needs better optimisation for mobile devices and any images may appear smaller than ideal when viewed in portrait mode on a phone. The [portfolio][portfolio.html] page is still under construction at the moment, but do definitely look forward to going into more depth into our current showreel work, as well as potentially looking into some Nuke scripts that I've found especially useful. ###

### Until then, I'm excited for future posts!  ###
