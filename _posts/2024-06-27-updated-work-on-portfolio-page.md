### The [portfolio][portfolio.html] page has been updated with all of our most recent work! It is still under construction (planning to add more descriptions and potential screenshots of Nuke scripts). This goes into a bit more detail on the breakdowns seen in my student showreel and how the final shot was composited together. ###

### There is also a page going over the Python scripts that I've made which I've found useful when undertaking any VFX work. There is currently only one script available at the moment, but I will be planning to add some scripts specifically for Nuke, which can help improve workflow.  ###

### I'm gradually getter better at HTML and hoping to make this website a lot more accessible. Until then, I'm looking forward to adding more to this website. ###
